<!-- The first race being referred to is not specified, but based on the context of the documents, it is likely referring to the first race of the 2023 XC World Cup season in Nove Mesto. The documents provide information on potential winners for both the men's and women's races. For the women's race, some of the top contenders include Haley Batten, Evie Richards, and Loana Lecomte, who has been consistently strong since her first win in 2020 [1]. For the men's race, Tom Pidcock is the clear favorite, having won the race in Nove Mesto in his only two times racing there [5]. However, Nino Schurter, who is still hunting for his record-breaking 34th win, is also a strong contender [5]. Other potential top performers include Pauline Ferrand Prevot, Jolanda Neff, and Sam Gaze [1, 3, 4]. -->
