    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Superpowered AI account with API keys (Sign up [here](https://superpowered.ai) for free access).\n",
    "2. The Superpowered AI Python SDK installed. You can install it using pip if you don't have it already: `pip install superpowered-sdk`\n",
    "3. An OpenAI account with an API key created, and the openai Python SDK\n",

      "Superpowered AI is a game-changer in the world of artificial intelligence. It offers a Knowledge Base as a Service (KBaaS) that allows developers to upload files and query them without having to deal with the messy stuff in the middle. But what are the possible use cases of Superpowered AI? Let's explore some of the exciting possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "One use case of Superpowered AI is a virtual employee Slack bot. You can upload company documents like internal knowledge bases, employee handbooks, and build a Slack bot that your employees can talk to whenever they have questions about internal policies and best practices. This can save time and increase efficiency in the workplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another exciting possibility is a copywriting assistant. Superpowered AI can help you generate high-quality content by using a multi-stage retrieval pipeline that involves a dense vector search. This can improve your content creation process and save you time and effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Superpowered AI can also be used in search engines. Its multi-stage retrieval pipeline can search seamlessly across different objects and keywords, providing better search results. This can be especially useful in e-commerce spaces where long-tail zero hits are common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Superpowered AI can also be used in natural language processing (NLP) applications. Its KBaaS can provide access to external knowledge sources and overcome the limitations of language models by integrating additional functionality into them. This can improve the accuracy and reliability of NLP applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are just a few of the exciting possibilities of Superpowered AI. With its KBaaS and multi-stage retrieval pipeline, it offers a powerful tool for developers to improve their applications and save time and effort. If you're interested in trying it out, Superpowered AI is currently offering free access for a limited time. So why not give it a try and see what you can build?\n"
