    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Superpowered AI is a Knowledge Base as a Service (KBaaS) that provides a robust and efficient way to create, store, and query knowledge bases. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how the real-time query endpoint can be used to efficiently search a webpage for information relevant to a specific query with a single API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous agents like AutoGPT can navigate the web and gather relevant information and perform actions. One challenge with building this kind of agent is that many webpages have too much text to fit into the context window of LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4. Agents can only see what's in their context window, so that's a problem. How can we expand access to things that don't fit in context? The answer is semantic search. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally this is done by breaking the text into chunks, creating vector embeddings for each chunk, uploading those vectors to a vector database, and then querying the database with the query embedding vector. For an application like web browsing, where you may never need to search that exact page again, this is a pretty inefficient way to do it. We've built a more efficient and cost-effective way to do this called real-time query. You simply provide the query along with the content you want to search in a single API call, and then we return the most relevant text snippets, as well as an LLM-generated summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Superpowered AI account with API keys (Sign up [here](https://superpowered.ai) for free access).\n",
    "2. Python 3 installed on your computer.\n",
    "3. `beautifulsoup4` and `requests` libraries installed (you can install them using `pip install beautifulsoup4 requests`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Set up the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will set up the environment by importing the required libraries and initializing the Superpowered AI SDK with our API keys."
